# Hexagram30 Codox Theme

This is a modern and responsive [codox][codox] theme developed for
use by hexagram30 projects and ultimately based based on
[codox-theme-rdash](https://github.com/xsc/codox-theme-rdash).

[![Hexagram30 Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexagram30/codox-theme/master/screenshots/screen-1-thumb.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexagram30/codox-theme/master/screenshots/screen-1.png)


Note that this needs codox â‰¥ 0.10.0.

[codox]: https://github.com/weavejester/codox


## Usage

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/hexagram30/codox-theme.svg)](https://clojars.org/hexagram30/codox-theme)

Then set the following:

```clojure
:codox {:themes [:hexagram30]}
```

For syntax highlighting capabilities, you'll need to activate Markdown rendering
via:

```clojure
:codox {:metadata {:doc/format :markdown}
        :themes [:hexagram30]}
```
